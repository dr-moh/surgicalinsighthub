He is complaining of abdominal pain and has an ecchymosis on his anterior abdominal wall where the seatbelt was located. Which of the following is the best next step in his management?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Discharge him home without any other workup.",
    "B": "Discharge him home if his amylase level is normal.",

    "D": "Discharge him home if an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan is negative.",
    "E": "Observe him regardless of negative test results."
  },
  "answer": "E",
  "explanation": {
    "correct": "The 'seatbelt sign' (ecchymosis on the abdominal wall) is associated with a high risk of small bowel or mesenteric injuries. These injuries are often not immediately apparent on CT scans or plain films. Therefore, clinical observation is mandatory regardless of negative initial imaging.",
    "A": "Discharging without workup is unsafe due to high risk of occult injury.",
    "B": "Amylase is neither sensitive nor specific for bowel or mesenteric injury.",
    "C": "Free air may not be present early in small bowel perforations.",

    "E": "Serial clinical examinations are the most reliable way to detect evolving peritonitis from bowel injury."

    "correct": "In a hemodynamically unstable patient (BP 85/60) with multiple severe injuries (femur, pelvis, abdomen), 'damage control' principles apply. While venous repair is preferred in stable patients, ligation of the popliteal vein is the safest and fastest option in an unstable patient to prioritize survival over limb salvage.",
    "A": "Simple closure is not possible for a transected vein.",
    "B": "Patching requires time that an unstable patient does not have.",
